This project implements rider helmet detection using YOLOv7 (an object detection model) and DeepSORT (an object tracking model) on a cctv recording. This is a group effort where each group were assigned to train combination of different hyperparameter setting and video time range and manually label images from the set of  video frames using roboflow.
