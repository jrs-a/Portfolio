This is an image processing task done with sklearn python library where we classify the images' facial expressions emotion namely: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise. Three classifiers were used: decision tree, naive bayes, and KNN.
Among the three classifiers used, the Decision Tree classifier is the most accurate with a 55% accuracy, whereas Naive Bayes and KNN classifiers had the lowest accuracy of 34%. The decision tree recall performs differently and better than its precision unlike the two other classifiers.
