This project documentation demonstrates the  creation of a comprehensive big data streaming pipeline and integration platform by incorporating Kafka for real-time data streaming, Cassandra for storage, Spark for processing, Talend for data integration, and Tableau for visualization. This integrated system enables seamless data flow from streaming to storage, processing, and visualization, offering a powerful solution for handling and analyzing large-scale data in real-time.
