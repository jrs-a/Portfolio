This is a documentation of the steps I've done and some important notes while developing this project

12-9-23
- [follow tutorial](https://youtu.be/zijOXpZzdvs?si=5Dt2kr56M4TAyt30)
- rename repo in github to jrs-a.github.io instead of the one in the tutorial so it automatically builds (tutorial ver is older so it didn't auto build i guess..)
- define header_pages on _config.yml file
- define collections on _config.yml file
- finish responsive home layout :D

later
- update site description in config file
